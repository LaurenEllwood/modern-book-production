### Proofreading

A professional proofreader reads every word of the final layout carefully, to find any small remaining errors.

Every publication must be checked with a fine-toothed comb for small errors and inconsistencies. This cannot be done by anyone who has already worked on the content, because familiarity with the content makes you blind to small errors. And it must only happen when further changes are unlikely.

A professional proofreader reads every word carefully, and marks all corrections. It’s normal for them to find an error on every page or two of a book. This is surprising to many people unfamiliar with publishing, but statistically speaking, a 60000-word book contains 60000 potential spelling errors, and almost as many potential errors in consistency, punctuation, and hyphenation. Good books are among the most complex products that humans produce. This is why professional, full-time proofreaders exist.

A production specialist will then implement the proofreader’s corrections; and another will check that they’ve all been implemented correctly.
