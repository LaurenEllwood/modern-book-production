### Software development

If special features require new software, the team briefs a software developer to prototype and refine them.

Good publishing software already supports a whole range of features and functionality out of the box. Beyond that, many projects have unique needs for which new software must be developed. For instance, special features for apps used in rural areas; custom code for a client’s unusual webserver; and interactive graphics from new data sources.

The team first develops a crystal clear idea of how new the features will work. This often involves doing research and creating visual mockups – drawings of every possible screen layout – before putting everything in a written brief for a software developer. The developer then works in cycles, starting with a simple implementation, getting feedback, and then building and refining before getting more feedback. Software development is expensive, so it’s important to be sure at every step that they’re building exactly what the project strategy requires.
