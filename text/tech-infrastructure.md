Based on the project plan, the team sets up its technical infrastructure. This includes the software and processes theyâ€™ll use to produce the book in all its formats. For instance, this might include setting up a master repository, a starting code base, automated and manual tests, deployment processes, metadata, staging sites, file-sharing locations, backups, project-tracking systems, and online access for clients and collaborators.
