### Writing

Working closely with the project director, the authors work hard to finish on time.
{:.summary}

Once clearly briefed, authors need time and guidance to finish their manuscripts â€“ their final, written work. To make this happen, the team works closely with the project director, who has the necessary authority to ensure that the writing is done on time.

Authors should be allowed to write in whatever software works for them. They must not have to think about their tools when they should be thinking about their writing.
