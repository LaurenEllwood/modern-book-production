### Permissions

A rights specialist gets permission to reuse others’ content, such as lyrics, illustrations, and photos.

You need permission to reuse other people’s content, no matter where you found it. This includes things like graphs, drawings, poems and lyrics, photographs, paintings, and more. As early as possible, a rights specialist starts gathering those permissions. It can often take months to find a rightsholder and get their permission.

The work of acquiring permissions continues in parallel with the rest of the production process.
