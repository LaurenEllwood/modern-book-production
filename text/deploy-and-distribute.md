### Deployment and distribution

It’s showtime! PDFs go to the printer, ebooks to retailers, and apps to app stores. Websites go live.

Throughout this process, the team has been producing PDFs, websites, ebooks or apps for review. Now it’s time for the project director to sign them off for public consumption.

The act of publishing takes many technical forms. We ‘deploy’ a website to a ‘live’ server. We send ‘print-ready PDFs’ to a printer, who prints and delivers copies to a warehouse, or prepares to print copies for customers on-demand.  We upload ‘distribution-ready epubs’ to retailers like Amazon Kindle. And we upload ‘app packages’ to app stores like Google Play.
