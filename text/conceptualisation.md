### Conceptualisation and planning

After research and workshops, the team writes a strategy and plan, and identifies the project director.

Any publishing project is [like starting a business](https://arthurattwell.com/2011/12/22/what-publishers-can-learn-from-publishing/). It is always going to be more expensive and take longer than you think to get right. Good strategic thinking and careful planning reduce the gap between expectations and reality.

So, in workshops and through research, the team gets down on paper a clear and simple strategy, and a thorough plan for executing on it.

For more on this process, see [‘How we plan and cost publishing projects’](https://electricbookworks.com/thinking/our-project-and-costing-process/), and [EBW's six keys to effective publishing projects](https://electricbookworks.com/thinking/workflow-lessons-from-dysfunctional-publishing-projects/).

It’s critical that everyone knows at this point who the project director is. This is one person, usually representing the rightsholder, who has ultimate authority over the project, including its budget, content, and contributors. In traditional publishing, this is the publisher or commissioning editor.

The project manager coordinates the team’s work. They keep the director up to date; manage schedules and briefs; ensure that everything happens on time and on budget; and troubleshoots when the unexpected inevitably happens.
