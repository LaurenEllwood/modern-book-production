### Stylesheets

A software developer writes CSS stylesheets that automate the layout according to the designer’s mockups.

Working from the final designs, a developer writes CSS templates. CSS (for ‘cascading style sheets’) is software code that controls how content is laid out on a web, ebook or PDF page. Once these CSS templates are written, layout can be automated.

Good CSS can be reused in many projects. It’s expensive to create at first, and then its cost can be amortised. This makes modern workflows cost-effective for large or long-term projects, such as very big books or series of books with similar features.
