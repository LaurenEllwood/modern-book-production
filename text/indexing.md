### Indexing

A professional indexer develops the index for the back of the book, a well-crafted taxonomy for navigating concepts.

Many books require a good index – the alphabetised list of concepts at the back of a book. This is the most underrated piece of work in a reference book. It takes years of training and experience for a professional indexer to be able to capture names, events and concepts faithfully, in appropriate detail, and in a taxonomic hierarchy that instantly makes sense to a reader. There are awards for indexes that are as hard to win as Pulitzers.

When an index is required, a professional indexer with the right kind of experience creates one from the proofread version of the book. They will need days or weeks to produce the index, and then a production specialist will add it to the book’s master files.
