### Page refinement

For high-end print editions, a designer–editor examines every page and refines the automated layout.

When producing a high-end, printed edition, some of the finer points of book-page layout can’t be automated, because they require human creativity and problem-solving. A production specialist – with both editorial and design skills – looks at every page and makes nuanced adjustments.

For example, the last line of a paragraph that starts on page one might appear at the top of page two, which to a book designer is an unsightly blot. By saving a line on page one (perhaps by imperceptibly reducing the space between characters), they can keep that paragraph together. Or they might notice that, in a textbook, moving a figure from the bottom of a page to the top makes for a better learning experience, based on how the text flows. These many small human decisions combine to create truly beautiful, effective pages.
