### Commissioning authors

The project director selects the best possible authors. The team briefs them thoroughly.

The project director is ultimately responsible for selecting the best possible team of authors, and convincing them to contribute â€“ sometimes for money, sometimes for free. When the project director has not already identified their authors, the team helps to find great people and briefs them. Each project has its own author dynamics.
