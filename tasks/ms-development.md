### Manuscript development

A development editor, who specialises in communicating ideas clearly, refines the authors’ work.

Usually, authors are experts in their field and not experts at writing and pedagogy. So the team often includes a development editor to rework or refine the original manuscript. This sometimes means heavily editing the authors’ work, reordering sections, writing new connected passages, and removing unnecessary text. Good development editors are a rare and special breed – unsung heroes behind many successful publications.

Like authors, development editors should use whatever software works for them. They will discuss with the authors how to resolve problems together, and whether to try to track their changes in a document. It’s usually not possible to track the kinds of broad changes that a development editor makes. Real-time, collaborative software like Google Docs is best for this, so that team members can always refer to a single master document, and discuss specific passages in comment threads.
